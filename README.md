# Data-Structure-Project-Hashing

This is a group project for a Data Structures course that demonstrates the practical application of a hash table. The program is a command-line-based restaurant menu management system written in C. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of restaurant dishes.

The core of this project is the implementation of a Hash Table with Chaining (Linked Lists) for collision resolution to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

**Features**
- **Add a New Dish** -> Users can insert a new dish by providing a name, price, rating, and description.
- **View All Dishes** -> Displays a complete list of all dishes currently stored in the system.
- **Search for a Dish** -> Efficiently finds and displays a specific dish using its unique ID.
- **Delete a Dish** -> Removes a dish from the menu after user confirmation.
- **Data Validation** -> The program includes input validation for all fields (e.g., name length, price range) to ensure data integrity.
- **Dynamic ID Generation** -> Automatically generates a unique ID for each new dish.
- **Hash Function** -> The hash key is generated by summing the ASCII values of the characters in the dish's unique ID and then taking the modulus of the table size SIZE = 100
- **Collision Resolution** -> To handle cases where two different dish IDs produce the same hash key (a "collision"), we use the **chaining method**. Each slot in the hash table can point to a linked list of dishes that map to that same index.
